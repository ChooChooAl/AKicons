Icon Theme where most folders have white tabs.
I have customized many icons for a more colorful appearance, filled in missing icons that would default to other less colorful themes.

There is a complimentary theme 'AKiconsB' that has black tabs on the folders.

Place AKiconsB folder and files in the ~/.icons folder for personal use.
Put AKiconsB folder and files in /usr/share/icons folder for global use.
